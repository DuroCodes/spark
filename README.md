Spark is an advanced [`discord.js`](https://discord.js.org/) handler built with TypeScript.

This repository is a monorepo, feel free to visit the `packages` directory for the packages `@spark.ts/logger` and `@spark.ts/handler`.

You can view a very basic example Discord Bot in the `apps` directory.

You can view the documentation & website for Spark [here](https://spark-handler.js.org).
