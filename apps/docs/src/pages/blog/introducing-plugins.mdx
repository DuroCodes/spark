# Spark Plugins

Spark now has plugin support! With plugins, you can create reusable actions with ease, without copy/pasting code between files.

## How to create a plugin

To create a plugin, simply create a function:

```ts filename="src/plugins/ownerOnly.ts"
// This is an example plugin for a 'owner only' slash command plugin.
// For a text command plugin, you'd just have to use message instead of interaction.

import { SlashCommandPlugin } from '@spark.ts/handler';

export function ownerOnly(ownerIds: string[]): SlashCommandPlugin {
  return {
    // Description of the plugin, this is mainly for documentation.
    description: 'Only allows the owner to run the command.',

    // Logic for the plugin.
    async run({ interaction, controller }) {
      if (ownerIds.includes(interaction.user.id)) {
        return controller.next();
      }

      await interaction.reply({
        content: `Only these people can run this!\n${mapUsers(ownerIds)}`,
        ephemeral: true,
      });

      return controller.stop();
    },
  };
}
```

## Adding plugins to commands

To add a plugin to a command, you can add the function inside of the `plugins` option in the `SparkCommand`.

For example, if you'd like to add the `ownerOnly` plugin to the command, you'd use:

```ts filename="src/commands/ownerOnly.ts"
import { SparkCommand } from '@spark.ts/handler';

export default new SparkCommand({
  type: CommandType.Slash,
  // Example id -> '283312847478325251' (Duro#5232)
  plugins: [ownerOnly(['283312847478325251'])],
  run({ interaction }) {
    // This only executes if the ownerOnly() plugin passed.
    // You can use this plugin to check for an owner, or just as a template.
    interaction.reply('You are allowed to use this command!');
  },
});
```

## Controller

With plugins, you have the `controller` option in the run function. With the controller, you can specify when to stop or continue with the action.

For example, if you'd like to return an `Err`, or specify that the plugin failed, you'd return `controller.stop()`. This would make the command execution stop.

If you'd like to continue with the command, you have to return `controller.next()`, this means that the controller should continue with whatever action.

## Flowchart

Here's a flowchart that shows the execution of commands:
