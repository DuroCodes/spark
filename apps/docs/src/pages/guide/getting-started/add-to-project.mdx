# Adding to Your Bot

## Commands

If you'd like to add a new command to your Spark bot, simply create a new file in the commands directory with your command.

View the [`adding commands`](/guide/core-concepts/adding-commands) section for more information.

You can also create subfolders to organize your commands.

## Events 

If you'd like to create a new event listener for your bot, simply create a new file in your events directory and put the event listener there.

View the [`adding events`](/guide/core-concepts/adding-events) section for more information.

Similarly to commands, you can create subfolders to organize your events.
