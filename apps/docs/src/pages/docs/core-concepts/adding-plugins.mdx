# Adding Plugins

Plugins are a way to reuse code between multiple different commands, without writing the same code twice.

It's recommended that you have a directory for plugins, and you can use that directory to import it to your commands.

For example, you could make an `Owner Only` plugin like this:

```ts filename="src/plugins/ownerOnly.ts"
// This is an example plugin for a 'owner only' slash command plugin.
// For a text command plugin, you'd just have to use message instead of interaction.

import { SlashCommandPlugin } from '@spark.ts/handler';

export function ownerOnly(ownerIds: string[]): SlashCommandPlugin {
  return {
    // Description of the plugin, this is mainly for documentation.
    description: 'Only allows the owner to run the command.',

    // Logic for the plugin.
    async run({ interaction, controller }) {
      if (ownerIds.includes(interaction.user.id)) {
        return controller.next();
      }

      await interaction.reply({
        content: `Only these people can run this!\n${mapUsers(ownerIds)}`,
        ephemeral: true,
      });

      return controller.stop();
    },
  };
}
```

<Callout>
  This plugin only works for a slash command. Notice the return signature, `SlashCommandPlugin`.
</Callout>

## Command Integration

To integrate this plugin to one of your commands, first check that your command and plugin are of the same type. (You cannot use text plugins with a slash command)

To add a plugin to your command, just import the function and then add it to the `plugins` option:

```ts filename="src/commands/ownerOnly.ts" {6}
import { SparkCommand } from '@spark.ts/handler';
// This import is using a path alias, `~` for the `src` directory.
import { ownerOnly } from '~/plugins/ownerOnly.js';

export default new SparkCommand({
  plugins: [ownerOnly('<your user id would go here>')],
  run({ interaction }) {
    // This would only be executed if the plugin passed.
    interaction.reply('You are permitted to use this command!');
  },
});
```

## Controller

The controller is what controls your flow of your code. If you do `controller.stop()` in your command, it'll stop the execution of your command.

Please make sure to return this upon an error in your plugin. For example, if the user is not permitted to use the command, you return `controller.stop()` in your plugin.

If you have a success in your plugin, return `controller.next()`. This will continue on with the command, and other plugins.
