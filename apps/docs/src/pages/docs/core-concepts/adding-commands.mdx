# Adding Commands

To create a new command for your Spark bot, create a file that ends with `.js` or `.ts` in your commands directory.

Please make sure that if you're using TypeScript, that your commands directory points to your `dist` folder.

This page is written in TypeScript, if you're using CommonJS, please convert the `import` to the `require()` function. You may also have to change the `export default ...` to `module.exports = ...`

## Slash Commands

```ts filename="src/commands/ping.ts" copy
import { SparkCommand, CommandType } from '@spark.ts/handler';

export default new SparkCommand({
  type: CommandType.Slash, // you can also use 'slash'
  name: 'ping', // if you don't input this, it'll use the file name (ex: foo.ts -> 'foo')
  description: 'replies with pong', // if you don't input this, it'll use '...'
  run({ interaction, client }) {
    client.logger.debug('pong');
    interaction.reply('pong');
  },
});
```

Inside of the run function, you can use `interaction`, `client`, and `args`. (`args` is the same as `interaction.options`)

### Publishing

To publish your command, add the `Plugins.Publish()` plugin from `@spark.ts/handler`.

```ts
import { SparkCommand, CommandType, Plugins } from '@spark.ts/handler';

export default new SparkCommand({
  type: CommandType.Slash, // you can also use 'slash'
  name: 'ping', // if you don't input this, it'll use the file name (ex: foo.ts -> 'foo')
  description: 'replies with pong', // if you don't input this, it'll use '...'
  plugins: [Plugins.Publish()],
  run({ interaction, client }) {
    client.logger.debug('pong');
    interaction.reply('pong');
  },
});
```

You can add various options to the publish plugin:

```ts
export interface PublishOptions {
  guildIds?: GuildId[]; // type GuildId = `${number}`;
  dmPermission?: boolean; // whether the bot should publish the command in dms
  defaultMemberPermissions?: PermissionResolvable | null; // default member permissions to run the command
}
```

## Text Commands

```ts filename="src/commands/ping.ts" copy
import { SparkCommand, CommandType } from '@spark.ts/handler';

export default new SparkCommand({
  type: CommandType.Text, // you can also use 'text'
  name: 'ping', // if you don't input this, it'll use the file name (ex: foo.ts -> 'foo')
  description: 'replies with pong', // if you don't input this, it'll use '...'
  run({ message, client }) {
    client.logger.debug('pong');
    message.reply('pong');
  }
})
```

Inside of the run function, you can use `message`, `client`, and `args`. (`args` is an array of strings)

Inside of message commands, you can add the `aliases` property, where you can define an array of aliases for your command.

## Plugins

As of `@spark.ts/handler` version 1.2.0, you can create plugins for your commands.

You can view more information on the [plugin page](/docs/core-concepts/adding-plugins)
