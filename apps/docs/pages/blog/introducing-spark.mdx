# Introducing Spark

Spark is a next-generation Discord.js handler built with TypeScript in mind.

If you'd like to start using Spark, you can view our [`quickstart`](/docs) for more information on how to setup a bot.

## Why?

### Simplicity

Spark is built to be simple and easy to use for everyone.

It only takes a few lines of code to create your first command, for example, here's a ping command.

```ts filename="src/commands/ping.ts"
import { SparkCommand, CommandType } from '@spark.ts/handler';

export default new SparkCommand({
  type: CommandType.Slash,
  run({ interaction }) {
    interaction.reply('pong');
  },
});
```

Spark was also designed to be ease for the average Discord.js user to start using.
This means that you don't have to learn anything new, you can apply your concepts from Discord.js into Spark.

### CLI Tool

With Spark's CLI tool, `create-spark`, you can create a new Spark project in just a few seconds.

All you have to do is answer a few questions, and your Spark project is setup for you!
