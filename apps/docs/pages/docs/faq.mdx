## How Do I Access Commands

With a normal Discord.js handler, you would be able to access commands with `client.commands` (or something similar). With Spark, this is a little different.

Spark uses the `Store` object to store commands. You can import this via `import { Store } from '@spark.ts/handler'`, or `const { Store } = require('@spark.ts/handler')`.

For example, instead of doing `client.commands`, you would do `Store.applicationCommands` for application (slash) commands.
