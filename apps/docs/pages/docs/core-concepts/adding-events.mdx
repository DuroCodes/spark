# Adding Events

To create a new event for your Spark bot, create a file that ends with `.js` or `.ts` in your events directory.

Please make sure that if you're using TypeScript, that your events directory points to your `dist` folder.

This page is written in TypeScript, if you're using CommonJS, please convert the `import` to the `require()` function. You may also have to change the `export default ...` to `exports.default = ...`

## Ready Event

If you'd like to create a ready event for example, you can use the following code.

```ts filename="src/events/ready.ts"
import { SparkEvent } from '@spark.ts/handler';
import { Events } from 'discord.js';

export default new SparkEvent({
  name: Events.ClientReady, // you can also use 'ready'
  run(client) {
    client.logger.success(`${client.user.tag} is now online!`);
  },
});
```

Inside of the run function, you should receieve intellisense for the parameters.

For example, if you had an `interactionCreate` event, your first parameter should have the type `Interaction`

If you don't input a name for your event, Spark will use the file's name. For example, if your file was called `interactionCreate`, it would use `'interactionCreate'` for the name property.
